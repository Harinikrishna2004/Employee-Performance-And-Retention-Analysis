To derive data-driven, actionable insights from the models built and provide strategies to enhance performance and reduce employee attrition.

Key Findings
1. Factors Influencing Employee Performance (From Regression & Deep Learning models):
Salary and Experience show strong positive correlation with performance scores.


Employees in the Technical and R&D departments tend to have higher performance metrics.


Age has a moderate effect; mid-career professionals (30â€“40) generally perform better.


High training scores and engagement levels contribute significantly to better performance.


2. High-Risk Groups for Attrition (From Classification model):
Sales and Support departments show higher attrition risk.


Low performance scores and lack of promotion correlate with higher attrition.

Attrition is higher among employees with low satisfaction scores or no upskilling opportunities.

Recommendations:

1. Department-Wise Performance Improvement Plans

2. Employee Retention Strategies

3. Predictive Monitoring

Conclusion:

Combining statistical insights with machine learning predictions, we can:

Proactively improve employee productivity.
