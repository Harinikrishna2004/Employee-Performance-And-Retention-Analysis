**Objective:**

To derive data-driven, actionable insights from the models built and provide strategies to enhance performance and reduce employee attrition.

**Key Findings:**

*1. Factors Influencing Employee Performance (From Regression & Deep Learning models):*

  1. Salary and Experience show strong positive correlation with performance scores.

  3. Age has a moderate effect; mid-career professionals (30â€“40) generally perform better.


  4. High training scores and engagement levels contribute significantly to better performance.


*2. High-Risk Groups for Attrition (From Classification model):*

  1. Sales and Support departments show higher attrition risk.


  2. Low performance scores and lack of promotion correlate with higher attrition.


  3. Employees under age 30 and with less than 2 years of experience are more likely to leave.


  4. Attrition is higher among employees with low satisfaction scores or no upskilling opportunities.

**Recommendations:**

1. Department-Wise Performance Improvement Plans

2. Employee Retention Strategies

3. Predictive Monitoring

**Conclusion:**

1. Combining statistical insights with machine learning predictions, we can:

2. Proactively improve employee productivity.

3. Design department-specific engagement strategies.
